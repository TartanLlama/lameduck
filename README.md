========

A brainfuck to x64 compiler written live in an hour during [CPPP](https://cppp.fr).

Requirements:

- [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) (installed and on the path)
- [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
- A C++ toolchain (you'll likely need to fix up the paths yourself since I hardcoded them for my setup)
